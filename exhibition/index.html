    <h1>Beyond Western Borders</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Hemy Rhee</h2>
    <p>Personally, I wanted to create an art exhibition that features a stronger focus on Asian artists because I feel like most net art I’ve seen was focused on European or American art. As an Asian myself, I was interested in how their net art will translate as they are living across the world. I looked forward to seeing what kinds of concepts and topics they discussed as well. I wanted to see their perspective on certain events that may be common to us, or how they incorporate their identity into their art. I found it interesting how the aesthetics were based off of Asian literature and art sometimes. I chose artworks that are more recent (after 2010), as they are more relevant to me.</p>

    <p>Kurokawa collected data relating to the study of the formation of stars from the satellites of various space stations around the world to create a scene of nature.
