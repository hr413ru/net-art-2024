      Tonight was a bit special—well, you supposed it was not particularly that special, but it was something out of the ordinary. There was a rainstorm expected to hit the city they lived in, so your boss (and friend), Uki, decided to close the store earlier than usual. The rain made a light thrumming against the windows, glossing the outside streets with a reflection of the buildings. You were mopping the floor away while singing a small tune you heard on the radio that morning, making sure every corner was squeaky clean. Your coworkers already head out for the day, and you were left to wrap up the store. <a href="preface4.html">〉</a>
