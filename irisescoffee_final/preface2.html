        Another thing the barista noticed was that, usually, the raven haired man was dressed in a comfy outfit. You liked how he always seemed so unapologetic with his iconic purple sling bag that seemed to fit everything inside of it. You also couldn’t help but notice his usual order, which was a simple black coffee with a side of croissant. And… There were too many moments where you missed the chance to ask for his name (especially because they ran on a system of calling out order numbers rather than actual names). It was to the point where you felt embarrassed that you didn’t know the regular’s name. You didn’t even remember when the customer began coming so frequently. <a href="preface3.html">〉</a>
