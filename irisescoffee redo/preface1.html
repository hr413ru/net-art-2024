        Past a tiring evening with a bustling city outside, there was always one university student that entered the café around an hour before it closed. During your night shifts, you would find the man spacing out, looking far into the distance of neon lights flickering against the night—as if he were searching for something. The few interactions you’d had with him were either writing up an order, or that one time the other had offered you some cough drops. You were having a horrendous cough that day, even behind your mask, so you appreciated the small gesture. You might've become biased after that, and sometimes found youself giving extra sides to the stranger’s usual order, claiming it was on the house (was not). <a href="preface2.html">〉</a>
