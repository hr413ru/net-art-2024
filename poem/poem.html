    <p>&nbsp;upon the shimmering white pearl rocks<br>glistened the moonlight at its wake.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;like a lighthouse, it was casting to find something<br>or better yet, someone.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;as if the waves thrash against the eroding land, <br>pushing into their cracks, only to lose their momentum to it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;as the wind picks up to take away<br></p>
	<ul>
        <li>the neverending scent of salt.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>the gloom from this morning stained the stones,<br>	reminding him of something that</p>
	<h4>felt</h4>		<h5>so</h5>		<h6>close.</h6>

    <p>&nbsp;he thought he <b>understood</b>, <br><em>but perhaps he didn’t.</em></p>

    <p>&nbsp;he pondered how</p>
    <ol>
        <li>lonely the seafoam on the ocean was.</li>
        <li>how the pelicans flew so high, only<br>to come back down to the deep sea.</li>
        <li>why the ocean always seemed to<br>remind him of home…</li>
    </ol>
	<p>perhaps he’ll never know.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;even when the day where he gravitates to the moon<br>he would never quite understand</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPFSe-VabI">the reflective light that the moon radiates.</a>
