    <h1>VRChat Infiltration & Interaction</h1>

      <h2>Journaling</h2>
      <h3>First World</h3>
      <p>My first world was not very fruitful at all. I joined a world called the <i>“Black Cat”</i> as it was very popular, but many of the people were having discussions that I didn’t really want to be a part of (mostly being explicit). There were also people running around the world while yelling slurs, so I quickly left the world. </p>

      <h3>Meeting A Friend Group</h3>
      <p>I am currently learning Japanese, so I went to another world where there were specifically Japanese-learners (not Japanese people). It was a world called <i>“Japan Shrine [Spring]</i>,” and I quickly found nicer people to talk to. It was a bit crowded with many foreigners, but I was able to meet a guy named Chilidawg, who was kind enough to have a discussion with me. He wasn’t really actively learning Japanese, but he said he’d come to the world simply to chat with others. After much talking, I figured out he was actually a Korean—but his English was so near perfect that I didn’t notice. As my parents are Korean, I knew some Korean already, but I was not familiar with slang in Korean and such. Once Chili became aware of this, he immediately began to teach me some Korean words, such as <i>“inssa,”</i> which is a slang that refers to someone who is extremely extroverted and socially active.</p>

      <p>Through Chili, I was able to quickly meet other friends such as Goldenn_c or JLoy, who were both quite kind but also a bit loud. We also met someone called dwmzu, also known as Dew. Golden is from India, but also speaks almost near-perfect English. Him, me, and Dew quickly became close friends as we were all the same age. JLoy is Malaysian Chinese, which was interesting to me because I didn’t really know that there was such a large population of Malaysia that spoke some kind of Chinese. You could tell that JLoy was still learning English, but his understanding of the language was expansive.</p>

      <p>These two guys decided to teach me more explicit and crazy things in their languages (although, at first, they didn’t know what to teach me when I asked), but were still overwhelmingly willing to teach me about their countries and cultures. I learned what life was like in India, such as Golden’s power cutting every morning at a certain time (for reasons he wasn’t sure about either), or how many people ride a single motorcycle together in India for convenience. Dew on the other hand was very soft-spoken, and didn’t really talk much until we figured out that we had similar interests. Dew was born in the Philippines, but he was raised in Canada. He also was learning Japanese, so we clicked very quickly. He taught me words in Tagalog like <i>“mahirap ng English”</i> or <i>“gets ko na,”</i> meaning “English is difficult” and “got it.”</p>

      <p>The four of us found ourselves traveling to other worlds in VRChat, and we went to quite a few cultured related ones such as the <i>"Taiwan Excellence World,"</i> that taught us about Taiwan’s traditions and lifestyle. I had more fun than I had expected I would.</p>

      <h3>Friendly Encounters</h3>
      <p>Later on in the week, I decided to travel out of that friend group a bit and find more people who were willing to talk to me. I went to <i>“Poppy Street,”</i> which was apparently quite popular amongst Japanese people. When I went there, I was hit with difficult Japanese, but was able to find a fluent English speaker who was Japanese. His name is Scott, and he was down to teach me slang in Japanese as well. I learned words like <i>“wanchan”</i> (there’s a possibility) or <i>“choberiba”</i> (really bad). I had never spoken to a native Japanese speaker in this manner before, so it was really eye-opening. Something I found interesting among these Asian countries was that most of them did not like meeting people of the same country, as they usually have bad experiences with them. Even when I talked to Chili, asking him why he was in <i>“Japan Shrine”</i> and not a Korean-based world, he simply said he did not like the “negative energy” in Korean worlds, and didn’t really have wishes to talk to them.</p>

      <p>Soon after, I met a Brazilian named 7_to. Like Dew, he was soft spoken, but willing to discuss and teach me a few things in Brazilian as well. His English was also near-perfect, which was crazy to me because I didn’t realize how many countries could easily speak English and their native languages. Instead of teaching me slang, he taught me cringey pick up lines, like <i>“Quando você for se casar me convida… para ser (o noivo/a noiva),”</i> which directly translates to something like “when you are getting married, invite me… to be the bride/groom.” He also suggested places I should visit like <i>Lençóis Maranhenses</i> and <i>Foz do Iguaçu</i>, which looked beautiful to go to.</p>

      <p>This time, I went to a popular Korean world in VRChat called <i>“Hwabon Night,”</i> which is based on a real station in South Korea. I met two kids who were younger than me, who were both wonderful artists. These two, yoobuchowbab and suhyeok, brought many new perspectives from the people I’d met before. Everyone I’d met earlier were either my age or older, and spoke English fluently. These two kids were 16 years old, and couldn’t speak English all too well, but we had similar interests. There were times where I’d have to pull out a translator to talk to them, but in the end it was fine. We collectively understood there was a slight language barrier, but made it work. Yubu tried teaching me the difference between certain letters in Korean that I’d always been confused with, and really tried his best to explain it. In the VRChat world, there were pens. We’d often draw together to go around the language barrier, and it was really fun. I didn’t take a picture of it, but Yubu quite literally drew out a whole chart of the alphabet and started drawing heads to explain the tongue placement—he was very sweet. Suhyeok, on the other hand, truly reminded me of my little brother. He was very childish, but that’s what made our interaction more interesting.</p>

      <h3>Some things I took notice of:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I noticed that there are country specific worlds that people gravitate towards. For example, I briefly was able to enter a world filled with people from Thailand, and was told there was a world for Brazilians as well.</li>
        <li>I also noticed something very interesting. My new friend Golden was able to slightly understand Korean despite not knowing exactly what was being said, which was fascinating. He picked up on the tone of voice and would somehow correctly guess what we were talking about. He had a lot of Korean friends, but never learned Korean properly, so I think he just naturally picked up the sense to understand.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: Although I don’t mention it, there were a lot of times in the game where I had to sit somewhere in a world and just wait for people to talk. Sometimes people are idle, or just not willing to talk. I found the technique of sitting and listening to people before approaching them is a good idea, as it is very telling of what kind of person they are.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2> <h3>(a not really brief paragraph…)</h3>
      <p>To preface, VRChat is a game where people can select any kind of avatar and go into different worlds (3D) to talk with others or do activities. One of my friends described it as another form of social media, as you’re using voice chat or text chat to talk to each other. The reason why I chose this game was because I felt that it had a lot of potential. I would always see videos on it regarding harmful players, but some videos would highlight how they learned languages by just playing the game. My intervention was to simply go into VRChat and talk to people about languages because I wanted to see how easily someone could enter the game and learn. I talked in bits and pieces throughout March 4th to March 8th, as I had midterms. The only person who felt the effect of my intervention were the people I interacted with. We got to know each other as not only our cultures, but as humans, which I didn’t expect at all. I usually don’t stick around online friends for long, but these folks genuinely felt interested in me and vice versa. I feel like the reason why these people go on VRChat is mainly because no one can see you, only your avatar. People have implicit bias whether they are conscious of it or not, so having an avatar that represents you makes people more willing to talk. It’s also an online space, which makes it easier to approach people and ask questions. Personally, I rarely talk to men in real life because I am simply not used to doing so. My whole VRChat experience was talking to men, which was quite the surprise for me, but I felt comfortable (surprisingly). Overall, everyone was super willing to teach me things in their language, whether appropriate or not. They were open to talking to me about my culture, which may be because I was open about my culture too. If I had more time, I would’ve explored more worlds with other people, such as European or African countries. I think I would consider my timezone more, as people in Europe/Africa are fast asleep when I am going on during the night. I also wish I could’ve met more women to talk to and see how they would react to me learning their language.</p>
