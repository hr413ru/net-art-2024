  <p>Suddenly, Yuzu's hand was tightly gripping onto his sweater by his chest. His breathing was overwhelmingly heavy, his eyebrows tightly-knit as he seemed to be fighting off pain.</p>

    <p>“Are you alright?!” You rose from your seat, eagerly trying to help comfort the other. Yuzu briskly shook his head, before taking off toward the bathroom with his mouth covered. You stood there, feeling absolutely helpless and confused—what did you just witness? Was Yuzu alright—well, obviously not, but what was wrong? Was it your coffee, or you?</p>
    
   <p>Not wanting to invade Yuzu’s personal space, you sat at your seat, waiting for him like a dog on guard, as you watched the rainstorm calm down. After Yuzu’s comment, you couldn’t help but notice the raindrops that covered the window, the wearing of the wooden table, and the cars rushing to drive against the rain. Was this what Yuzu always saw every day?</p>
    
    <p>The bathroom door almost burst open as fast as Yuzu had entered it. Coughing weakly, the shorter man made his way toward you with an apologetic look.</p>
    
    <p>“Sorry, I’m not feeling that great right now,” you rose from your seat once again, rushing to go to him. You quickly noticed a light lavender colored petal stuck to his outfit that you swore wasn't there earlier, but paid it no mind as you had bigger concerns.</p>
    
    <p>“Hey, no worries, but is everything alright?” You placed your hand lightly on Yuzu’s shoulder, hoping to provide him some comfort through touch, “the rain is letting up, so maybe we should get you to a nearby hospital.”</p>
    
    <p>Yuzu paused to look at you, only to break out into a small smile, “ah, it’s fine. I got it checked up already.” He gave a light bow toward you, his voice slightly shaking, “I’ll take my leave, though, thank you for everything.”</p>
    
    <p>“Do you need someone to escort you? I’m just really worried…” </p>
    
    <p>“No, I’m… fine. Thank you, though, really!” Yuzu bowed again, walking toward the door in a rush. </p>
