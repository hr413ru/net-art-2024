  <p>Past a tiring evening with a bustling city outside, there was always one university student that entered the café around an hour before it closed. During your night shifts, you would find the man spacing out, looking far into the distance of neon lights flickering against the night—as if he were searching for something.</p>

  <p>The few interactions you’d had with him were either writing up an order, or that one time the other had offered you some cough drops. You were having a horrendous cough that day, even behind your mask, so you appreciated the small gesture. You might've become biased after that, and sometimes found youself giving extra sides to the stranger’s usual order, claiming it was on the house (when it was actually from your paycheck).</p>
    
  <p>Maaaybe you liked this regular a bit more than you should.</p>
    
  <p>Another thing the barista noticed was that, usually, the raven haired man was dressed in a comfy outfit. You liked how he always seemed so unapologetic with his iconic purple sling bag that seemed to fit everything inside of it. </p>
    
  <p>You also couldn’t help but notice his usual order, which was a simple black coffee with a side of croissant. And… There were too many moments where you missed the chance to ask for his name (especially because they ran on a system of calling out order numbers rather than actual names). It was to the point where you felt embarrassed that you didn’t know the regular’s name. You didn’t even remember when the customer began coming so frequently.</p>
    
  <p>Tonight was a bit special—well, you supposed it was not particularly that special, but it was something out of the ordinary. There was a rainstorm expected to hit the city they lived in, so your boss (and friend), Uki, decided to close the store earlier than usual. The rain made a light thrumming against the windows, glossing the outside streets with a reflection of the buildings. You were mopping the floor away while singing a small tune you heard on the radio that morning, making sure every corner was squeaky clean. Your coworkers already head out for the day, and you were left to wrap up the store.</p>
    
  <p>As soon as the clock struck 8 PM, you found your mind wandering, thinking about the regular. Your eyes kept making their way to the cafe’s door. You didn’t think he’d come at all considering how the weather was seemingly worsening every other moment, but something didn’t quite feel right if he wasn’t there on time. When your mind was about to fade into the white noise of pitter-patter, you heard a sudden thud against the door. You quickly rushed to see a dark figure standing outside the door, with an all-too-familiar purple sling bag.</p>
